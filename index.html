<p> <h1>Wonder of the science</h1>
  <h3>*science has been the focal point of human being's evolution from the every beginning</h3>
  <h3>*science is a logical systematic understanding of things to <b>ennance of knowledge</b> </h3>
  <h3>*science is the study of the nature and behaviour of nature things  and the knowledge tha we obtain about
  them</h3>
  <h3>*chemistry,physics& mathematics forms of the basic branches of the study of the science</h3>
  <h3>*Natural sciences include, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, and physics. Science uses mathematics
      and logic, which are sometimes called "formal sciences". Natural science makes observations and experiments.</h3>

<h2>science, any system of knowledge that is concerned with the physical world and its
phenomena and that entails unbiased observations and systematic experimentation. In general, a science involves a
pursuit of knowledge covering general truths or the operations of fundamental laws.
    Science can be divided into different branches based on the subject of study. The physical sciences study the
    inorganic world and comprise the fields of astronomy, physics, chemistry, and the Earth sciences. The biological
    sciences such as biology and medicine study the organic world of life and its processes. Social sciences like
    anthropology and economics study the social and cultural aspects of human behaviour.</h2>

      <h3>  The word “science” probably brings to mind many pictures: a fat textbook, white lab coats and microscopes,
          an astronomer peering through a telescope, a naturalist in the rainforest, Einstein’s equations scribbled on a
          chalkboard, the launch of the space shuttle, bubbling beakers …. All of those images reflect some aspect of science.
          But none of them provides a full picture because science has so many facets:</h3>

          <h3>*Science is both a body of knowledge and a process. In school, science may sometimes seem like a collection of
          isolated and static facts listed in a textbook, but that’s only a small part of the story. Just as importantly,
          science is also a process of discovery that allows us to link isolated facts into coherent and comprehensive
          understandings of the natural world</h3>

         <h3> *Science is exciting. Science is a way of discovering what’s in the universe and how those things work today,
          how they worked in the past, and how they are likely to work in the future. Scientists are motivated by the
          thrill of seeing or figuring out something that no one has before.</h3>

         <h3>*Science is a global human endeavor. People all over the world participate in the process of science.
          And you can too!</h3>
        <h1> Science facts</h1>
         <h3>Even if you weren’t someone who got excited about science class in school, now—as an adult—it’s hard not to
   be amazed by science facts. Seriously, just stop for a minute and think about what both the natural world and
   technology are capable of. It’s truly impressive, and chances are you only know a small fraction of the interesting
   facts and completely weird facts that scientists have uncovered so far.</h3>
      <h3>  After all, scientists are learning new things all the time. Something we don’t know today could be discovered
   tomorrow, so we can always expand our knowledge—and our reserve of random trivia to impress our friends.
    Just beware of the science “facts” that are actually false, unlike the 25 on this list. And remember, a little humor
   is just as important as a little knowledge, which is why you’ll also want to check out these hilarious science
   jokes, chemistry jokes, and biology jokes that are so funny, they cell themselves. (Sorry, we couldn’t help ourselves.)</h3>
